I noce had a teacher whose husband died suddenly of a heart attack.

About a week after his death, she shared some of her thoughts with a classroom of students.

As the late afternoon sunlight shone through the classroom windows and the class was nearly over, she removed a few things aside on the edge of her desk and sat down there.

With a gentle look on her face, she paused and said, "Before class is over, I'd like to share with all of you a thought that is unrelated to class, but which I feel is very important.

Each of us is put here on earth to learn, share, love, appreciate and give of ourselves.

None of us knows when this fantastic experience will end. 

It can be taken away at any moment, so we must make the most out of every single day."

Her eyes were beginning to water, but she went on, "So I would like you all to make me a promise.

From now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to enjoy, it doesn't have to be something you see.

It could be the smell of freshly baked bread floating out of someone's house, or it could be the sound of the breeze restling the leaves in the trees...

Please look for these things, and appreciate them, for at anytime they can all be taken away."

The class was completely quiet. We all packed up our books and went out of the room silently.

That afternoon, I noticed more things on my way home from school than usual.

Remember: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
