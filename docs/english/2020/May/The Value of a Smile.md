# 微笑的价值

### The Value of a Smile

## 翻译

The value of a smile is priceless, yet it is the cheapest, easiest, most rewarding and most sincere gift to anyone that crosses your path.

A smile makes a person's day, anybody's day even a stranger's day.

A smile is infectious. Start infecting people with your smile today.

A smile is nature's best `antidote` for discouragement.

It brings rest to the `weary`, sunshine to those who are sad, and hope to those who are hopeless and defeated.

A smile is so valuable that it can't be bought, begged, borrowed, or taken away against your will.

You have to be willing to give a smile away before it can do anyone else any good.

So if someone is too tired or `grumpy` to flash you a smile, let him have one of yours anyway.

Nobody needs a smile as much as the person who has none to give.
