There is only one person who is capable to set limits to your growth: it is you.

You are the only person who can revolutionize your life.

You are the only person who can influence your happiness, your realization and your success.

You are the only person who can help yourself.

Your life dose not change when your boss changes, when your friends change, when your parents change, when your partner chagnes.

Your life will changes when you change, when you go beyond your limiting beliefs, when you realize that you are the only one responsible for your life.

The most important relationship you can have, is the one you have with yourself!

Examine yourself, watch yourself. Don't be afraid of difficulties, impossibilities and losses. Be a winner, build yourself and your reality.

The world is like a mirror: it gives back to anyone the reflection of the thoughts in which one has strongly believed.

If an egg is broken from outside force, life ends. If an egg is broken from inside force, life begins.

Great things always begin from our inside as it's the way you face life that makes the difference!
