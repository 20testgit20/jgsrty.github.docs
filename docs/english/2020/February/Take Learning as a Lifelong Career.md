# 将学习视为终身事业

### Take learning as a Lifelong Career

## 翻译
As food is to the body, so is learning to the mind.

Our bodies grow and muscles develop with the intake of `adequate` `nutritious` food.

Likewise, we should keep learning day by day to maintain our `keen` mental power and expand our intellectual `capacity`.

Constant learning supplies us with `inexhaustible` fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning, analysis, and judgment.

Learning `incessantly` is the surest way to keep pace with the times in the information age, and an `infallible` `warrant` of success in times of uncertainty.

Once learning stops, vegetation sets in.

It is a common `fallacy` to regard school as the only workshop for the acquisition of knowledge.

On the contrary, learning should be a never-ending process, from the `cradle` to the grave.

With the world ever changing so fast, the cease from learning for just a few days will make a person lag behind.

What's worse, the animalistic instinct `dormant` deep in our `subconsciousness` will come to life, weakening our will to pursue our noble ideal, sapping our determination to sweep away obstacles to our success and strangling for the `refinement` of our character.

Lack of learning will `inevitably` lead to the `stagnation` of the mind, or even worse, its `fossilization`.

Therefore, to stay mentally young, we have to take learning as a lifelong career.

What's worse, the animalistic instinct dormant deep in our subconsciousness will come to life, weakening our will to pursue our noble ideal, sapping our determination to sweep away obstacles to our success and strangling for the refinement of our character.
