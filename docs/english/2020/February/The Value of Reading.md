### The Value of Reading
You do not need to read a book for the book's `sake`, but for your own.

You may read because in your high-pressure life, studded with problems and emergencies, you need `periods` of `relief` and yet recognize that peace of mind dose not mean `numbness` of mind.

You may read because you never had an opportunity to go to college, and books give you a chance to get something you missed.

You may read because your job is routine, and books give you a feeling of depth in life.

You may read because you did go to college.

You may read because you see social, economic and philosophical problems witch need solution, and you believe that the best thinking of all past ages may be useful in your age, too.

You may read because you are tired of the `shallowness` of `contemporary` life, bored by the current conversational `commonplaces`, and `wearied` of shop talk and gossip about people.

Whatever your `dominant` personal reason, you will find that reading gives knowledge, creative power, satisfaction and relaxation.

It cultivates your mind by calling its `faculties` into exercise.

Books are a source of pleasure -- the purest and the most lasting.

They enhance your `sensation` of the interestingness of life.

Reading them is not a violent pleasure like the `gross` enjoyment of an uncultivated mind, but a `subtle` delight.

Reading `dispels` prejudices which `hem` our minds within narrow spaces.

One of the things that will surprise you as you read good books from all over the world and from all times of man is that human nature is much the same today as it has been ever since writing began to tell us about it.

Some people act as if it were `demeaning` to them to wish to be well-read, but you can no more be a healthy person mentally without reading `substantial` books than you can be a vigorous person physically without eating solid food.
