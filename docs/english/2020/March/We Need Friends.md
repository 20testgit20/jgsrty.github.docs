# 我们需要朋友

### We Need Friends

## 翻译

The word, friend, covers a wide range of meanings.

It can be a nodding acquaintance, a `comrade`, a confidant, a partner, a playmate, an `intimate` colleague, etc.

Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life single-handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others.

In modern times, people attach more importance to relations and connections. A man of `charisma` has many friends. His power lies in his ability to give.

As life is full of strife and conflict, we need friends to support and help us out of difficulties.

Our friends give us warnings against danger. Our friends offer advice with regard to how to deal with various situations. True friends share not only your joys but also our sorrows.

With friendship, life is happy and `harmonious`. Without friendship, life is sad and unfortunate.

I have friends in high positions and friends in the rank and file. Some are rich and in power. Some are relatively poor and without power.

Some are like myself, working as a teacher, reading and writing, content with a simple life.

We all care for each other, love and help each other. We feel we are happiest when we chat and exchange ideas with one another.

With my friends, I know what to treasure, what to tolerate and what to share.

I will never forget my old friends, and I'll keep making new friends.
