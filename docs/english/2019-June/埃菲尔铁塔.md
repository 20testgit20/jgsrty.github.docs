Over the streets of Paris, France, rises the Eiffel Tower.

An internationally recognzied symbol of France and one of the most famous structures in the world, the Eiffel Tower was originally built as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.

More than 100 artists competed with plans for the monument, but the contract was given to Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel, a bridge builder, `architect`, and metals expert who had already designed the framework for the Statue of Liberty.

The final design required more than 18,000 pieces of iron and 2.5 million `rivets` to construct.

It took hundreds of workers more than 2 years to finish, and when it was completed in March of 1889 it was almost 1,000 feet or more than 300 meters hight -- more than twice the height of `pyramids` at Giza -- making it the tallest structure in the world until the Chrysler building was completed at 1930.

The tower was originally meant to be a temporary structure, and only stand for 20 years.

Mnay of the people of Paris disliked the tower.

They thought is was ugly, or that it was dangerous and might fall down.

By the time the tower was supposed to be removed, however, people had realized that it was a valuable way to transmit wireless telegraph and radio signals, and city officials decided to keep it.

It continues to be used for communications today, with more than 100 `antennas` on it.

`Despite` its height, the Eiffel Tower is `incredibly` wind-resistant.

It only sways up to five inches in wind, but when the side facing the sun heats up and expands, the top may move up to seven inches from its original position.

The tower is completely repainted every seven years to protect it from rusting, using 60 tons of paint each time.

Originally, the tower was reddish brown and the color was changed sometimes when it was repainted.

It was once even painted yellow!

These days it is painted a `bronze` color called "Eiffel Tower Brown."

Today, the Eiffel Tower is the most popular paid attraction in the world, with about 7 million visitors each year.

It has been the `inspiration` for `replicas` and `imitations` around the world, from Janpan to Guatemala to Las Vagas.

No longer considered an `eyesore`, the Eiffel Tower is an icon of France and is inside the World Heritage Site that includes certain parts of Paris.
