The first thing I want you to take away from today is this: you will have good days, and you will have bad days. But you will always learn something more or something new, and you'll learn more overall on bad days than good days.

You'll learn more about yourself, you'll learn more about realtionships, you'll learn about life and `principles` and you'll build your character.

If you're a person who wants to, let's say, improve on your character of patience, let's say, don't complain when you're waiting in a line. You ain't going to grow in a patience until you're put in a place to wait.

It's like you go into a gym and, you know, you walking through the front doors and, you know, you tell your wife or your husband I'm going to the gym. You got into the gym and you come in three feet, you do a U-turn and you ride out, I went to the gym. Ain't gonna do nothing.

You got to go in and what are you going to do? You're going to pick up the weights and you exercise the muscles that you want to build.

I stand before you without arms and legs, but a very strong man because of the bad days in my life. You know how it is. If you didn't go what you've gone through, you wouldn't be who you are today.

And I'm not `belittling` your pain and don't worry, I've seen pain in my life, and I've seen it not only in my life, but people's lives and people say well at least I have no arms and legs and then what am I supposed to say?

At least I'm not an African `orphan` who's dying at four years old and I've met that person.

What about the 10-years-old girl that was bought for 700 US dollars in Mamba, `kidnapped` as a sex slave, to have 350 clients before the age of 13, pregnant at 12, put the baby under the bed while she works on top, abandoned by her family.

After she pays her debt of 700 US dollars after three years with her child she leaves on the streets of Mamba hoping for a new life. No family, no job, no food.

Her baby needs food. She gets `raped`, beaten up on the street. She comes back to the only way that she knows how to make money. She gose back to the `brothels`.

She gets pregnant at 15 the second time and then that child dies and then at 20 years old she comes up to me, yes, I have met this woman.

She comes up crying and she says:"Nick, I just found I've got HIV AIDS. And I got fired from being a `prostitute`."

What do you say to that?

You may have arms and legs, but unless you know three things.

No.1, who are you and what your value is;  
No.2, what is your purpose here in life;  
No.3, what is your destiny when you're done here.

If you don't know the answers of any of those three questions, you're more disabled than I.
