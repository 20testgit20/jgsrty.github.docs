## 翻译
I wasn't born in this country. I didn't grow up in any one particular religion. I have a mixed race background, and I'm gay.

Like many of you here tonight, I grew up in what I would call `survival` mode.

When you are in survival mode, your focus is on getting through the day in one piece, and when you're in that mode at 5, at 10, at 15, there isn't a lot of space for words like "community", for words like "us" and "we".

There's is only space for "I" and "me".

The first time I tried to kill my self, I was 15. I waited until my family went away for the weekend and I was alone in the house and I `swallowed` a bottle of pills.

I don't remember what happened ove the next couple of days, but I'm pretty sure come Monday morning I was on the bus back to school, `pretending` everything was fine.

And when someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I say noe, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.

This letter, in which I speak my truth, and `integrate` my small story into a much larger and more inportant one, is worth sending.

I thought, let me be to someone else what no one was to me. Let me send a message to that kid, maybe in America, maybe some place far overseas, maybe somewhere deep inside, a kid who's being targeted at home or at school or in the streets, that someone is watching and listening and caring.

That there is an "us", that there is a "we", and that kid or teenager or adult is loved, and they are not alone.
