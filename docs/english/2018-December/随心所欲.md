Set yourself free from anything that might hinder you in becoming the person you want to be. Free youself from the uncertainties about your abilities or the worth of your dreams, from the fears that you may not be able to achieve them or that they won't be what you wanted.

Set youself free from the past. The good things from yesterday are still yours in memory, the things you want to forget you will, for tomorrow is only a sunrise away. Free yourself from regret or guilt, and promise to live this day as fully as you can.

Set youself free from the expectations of others, and never feel guilty or embarrassed if you do not live up to their standards. You are most important to yourself, live by what you feel is best and right for you. Others will come to respect your integrity and honesty.

Set yourself free to simply be yourself, and you will soar higher than you've ever dreamed.
