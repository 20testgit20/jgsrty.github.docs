# 什么才是重要的
### What Will Matter

## 翻译
Ready or not, some day it will all come to an end.

There will be no more sunrises, no days, no hours or minutes.

All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else.

Your wealth fame and `temporal` power will `shrivel` to `irrelevance`.

It will not matter what you owned or what you were owed.

Your `grudges`, `resentments`, `frustrations`, and jealousies will finally disappear.

So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans, and to-do lists will all `expire`. The wins and losses that once seemed so important will fade away.

It won't matter where you came from, or on what side of the tracks you lived.

It won't matter whether you were beautiful or brilliant.

So what will matter? How will the value of your days be measured?

What will matter is not what you bought, but what you built; not what you got, but what you gave.

What will matter is not your success, but your significance.

What will matter is not what you learned, but what you taught.

What will matter is every act of `integrity`, `compassion`, courage and `sacrifice` that enriched, empowered or encouraged others to `emulate` your example.

What will matter is not your `competence`, but your character.

What will matter is not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting loss when you're gone.

What will matter is not your memories, but the memories of those who loved you.

What will matter is how long you will be remembered, by whom and for what.

Living a life that matters doesn't happen by accident.

It's not a matter of `circumstance` but of choice.
