# 我们这个时代的悖论
### The Paradox of Our Time

## 翻译
The paradox of our time is that we have taller buildings but shorter vision, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints.

We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy less.

We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

We drink too much, smoke too much, laught too little, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, and watch TV too much.

We have multiplied our possessions, but reduce our values.

We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

We've learn how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years.

We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.

We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.

We've clean up the air, but pulluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.

We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes.

Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.

Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it.

A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.

Life is not measured by the number of breaths was take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
