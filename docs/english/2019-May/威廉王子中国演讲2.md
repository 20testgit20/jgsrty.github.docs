## 翻译
Today we face an `unprecedented` `surge` in the `brutal` `slaughter` of iconic animals by `poachers`.

In South Africa, for example, one `rhino` was kiiled every month until 2005.

But last year, three rhinos were killed every single day.

In the 33 years since I was born, we have lost around 70% of Africa's elephant population.

Of those that are left, 20,000 are being killed every year.

That is 54 elephants killed every single day.

At this rate, children born this year, like my daughter Charlotte, will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdays.

Those who suffer the most from this loss are some of the poorest people on our planet.

They are the families who feel powerless as wildlife around them disapper, who face being trapped in poverty forever, without the income that should be brought in by tourism, a cornerstone of the economy in many developing nations.

They are the children whose parents risk their lives in the fight against poachers.

In the last few days, three `rangers` and one member of the armed `forces` were killed by peachers in one `incident` in Central Africa, leaving behind 14 children between them.

It is these children's future that is `blighted` so `tragically` by the illegal wildlife trade, and it is their birthright that is stolen.

There is no hiding from these facts today.

On our phones, laptops and our TV screens, we can see the images and read the reports that lay bare the truth of this crisis.

That knowledge brings responsibility: the responsibility to do every thing in our power to reverse the march towards eradications of these fine animals.

The good news is that we are far from powerless in this struggle.

We can turn the `tide` of `extinction`.

We know where the animals we are trying to protect live.

We know many of the road, the airports and the ports criminals use to transfer their cargo, from killed fields to marketplace.
