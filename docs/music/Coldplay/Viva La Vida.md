# Viva La Vida
### 生命万岁

## 翻译
I used to rule the world

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Now in the morning I sleep alone

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice

Fell the fear in my enemy's eyes

Listen as the crowd would sing:

"Now the old king is dead

Long live the king"

One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me

And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon `pillars` of salt' pillars of sand

I hear `Jerusalem` bells a ringing

Roman `Cavalry` `choirs` are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

Once you'd gone there was never'

Never an honest word

That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind

Blew down the doors to let me in

`Shattered` windows and the sound of `drums`

People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait

For my head on a silver plate

Just a `puppet` on a lonely string

Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)

Hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I rulled the world

## 歌曲背景
>克里斯·马汀（酷玩乐队主唱）在看了二十世纪墨西哥艺术家弗里达·卡罗的一幅画后产生了《Viva La Vida》创作灵感，他将画作的名字作为了该首歌的标题。在西班牙语中，"viva"表达着向某人或者某事喝彩的意思。一天夜晚，克里斯·马汀坐在钢琴边，慢慢地有了这首歌的感觉。克里斯·马汀坐一边歌，一边他写的唱给强尼·巴克兰（酷玩乐队吉他手），当强尼感到满意时克里斯就会把写的部分给威尔·查平（酷玩乐队鼓手）
