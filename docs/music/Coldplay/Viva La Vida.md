# Viva La Vida
### 生命万岁
>克里斯·马汀（酷玩乐队主唱）在看了二十世纪墨西哥艺术家弗里达·卡罗的一幅画后产生了《Viva La Vida》创作灵感，他将画作的名字作为了该首歌的标题。在西班牙语中，"viva"表达着向某人或者某事喝彩的意思。一天夜晚，克里斯·马汀坐在钢琴边，慢慢地有了这首歌的感觉。克里斯·马汀坐一边歌，一边他写的唱给强尼·巴克兰（酷玩乐队吉他手），当强尼感到满意时克里斯就会把写的部分给威尔·查平（酷玩乐队鼓手）

I used to rule the world

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice

Fell the fear in my enemy's eyes

Listen as the crowed would sing:

"Now the old king is dead

Long live the king"

One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me

And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon pillars of salt' pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

Once you know there was never'

Never an honest word

That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind

Blew down the doors to let me in

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait

For my head on a silver plate

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)

Hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I rulled the world

## Lyric 歌词
I used to rule the world

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Now in the morning I sleep alone

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice

Fell the fear in my enemy's eyes

Listen as the crowed would sing:

"Now the old king is dead

Long live the king"

One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me

And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon pillars of salt' pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

Once you know there was never'

Never an honest word

That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind

Blew down the doors to let me in

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait

For my head on a silver plate

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)

Hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I rulled the world
