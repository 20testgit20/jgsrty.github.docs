# What Are Words

## 翻译
Anywhere you are, I am near

Anywhere you go, I'll be there

Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see

How every single promise I keep

Cause what kind of guy would I be

If I was to leave when you need me most

What are words

If you really don't mean them 

When you say them

What are words

If they're only for good times

Then they done

When it's love 

Yeah, you say them out-loud those words

They never go away

They live on, even when we're gone

And I know an angel was sent just for me

And I know I'm meant to be where I am

And I'm gonna be standing right beside her tonight

And I'm gonna be by your side

I would never leave when she needs me most

What are words

If you really don't mean them

When you say them

What are words

If they're only for good times

Then they done

When it's love 

Yeah, you say them out-loud those words

They never go away

They live on, even when we're gone

Anywhere you are, I am near

Anywhere you go, I'll be there

And I'm gonna be here forever more

Every single promise I keep

Cause what kind of guy would I be

If I was to leave when you need me most

I forever keeping my angel close

## Lyric 歌词
Anywhere you are, I am near

Anywhere you go, I'll be there

Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see

How every single promise I keep

Cause what kind of guy would I be

If I was to leave when you need me most

What are words

If you really don't mean them 

When you say them 

What are words

If they're only for good times

Then they done

When it's love

Yeah, you say them out-loud those words

They never go away

They live on, even when we're gone

And I know an angel was sent just for me

And I know I'm meant to be where I am

And I'm gonna be standing right beside her tonight

And I'm gonna be by your side

I would never leave when she needs me most

What are words 

If you really don't mean them

When you say them

What are words 

If they're only for good times

Then they done

When it's love 

Yeah, you say them out-loud those words

They never go away

They live on, even when we're gone

Anywhere you are, I am near

Anywhere you go, I'll be there

And I'm gonna be here forever more

Every single promise I keep

Cause what kind of guy would I be 

If I was to leave when you need me most

I'm forever keeping my angel close
