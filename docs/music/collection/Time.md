# Time
### 时间 -- MKJ
Money is not evil by itself

Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways

If not money -- what is evil you may ask?

Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more

Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold

At the end of some rainbow which doesn't exist

Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost

Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again

Until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone

Make more time

I'm not saying you can't be financially successful

I'm saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success

Your soul is streaming for you to answer your true calling

You can change today if you redefine what success is to you

You can transform your damaged realtionships and build new ones

You can forgive yourself and others who've hurt you

You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like

You can re-balance your priorities in life

You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible

You can become the best parent possible at any age -- even 86

but don't wait until then...

You will always be able to make more money

But you cannot make more time

## Lyric 歌词
Money is not evil by itself

Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways

If not money -- what is evil you may ask?

Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more

Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold

At the end of some rainbow which doesn't exist

Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost

Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again

Until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone

Make more time

I'm not saying you can't be financially successful

I'm saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success

Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling

You can change today if you redefine what success is to you

You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones

You can forgive yourself and others who've hurt you

You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like

You can re-balance your priorities in life

You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible

You can become the best parent possible at any age -- even 86

but don't wait until then...

You will always be able to make more money

But you cannot make more time
